# Redux App vs React Component

Benefits of React Component:
- Composable
- Simple and Common Api (passing props, calling refs, ...)

Benefits of Redux App:
- Sane approach to handle state (reducers, pure components, Action Creators)
- Flexible and Powerfull (middlewares)
- Devtools, and easy debug

You can have best from both worlds, developing your component with redux and them wrapping it with this lib.
